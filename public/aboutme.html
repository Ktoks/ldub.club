                    I’ve been on my dance fitness journey for almost ten years now. The last 8 of them have been at Elevation Fitness. I have
                    had many adventures and learning experiences in that time. As I have changed, my class has evolved and has developed
                    into something greater every year. As I’m open to share gifts and be open to others gifts, I’m finding my class is
                    lifting me to higher levels. Always wanting to bring the best version of me out. For years my LDUB CLUB has been what
                    has helped me survive through life. I now thrive to encourage and inspire others even more than ever! I care about you
                    and your well being. I care about your health and fitness! I care about you inside and out! Many of you have watched me
                    work on my personal development, physically, mentally, spiritually, financially and all the ways! When you put your head
                    down and do some work, it helps you focus and appreciate what truly makes you happy. It also pushes you to the next big
                    thing. Now that time has come for me where my visions, aspirations, goals and dreams are creating opportunities. I’ve
                    read just enough and been through thousands of quotes to know it’s time to be brave and step into all that I could be.
                    
                    With that, I am announcing that Thursday August 29th at 5:30 p.m. will be my last class at Elevation Fitness. I would
                    like to appreciate Scott and Anna Marie for the space to learn, grow and create my class, for that I am truly grateful.
                    I couldn’t be more blessed for the amazing people I’ve met and the quality of relationships I’ve gained. The
                    transformations, inspiration, dedication, belief and raw real truth is what I cherish so much of all those that have
                    been a part of the club.
                    
                    Elevation members and LDUB Clubbers I love you from the bottom of my heart and depths of my soul! You are some of the
                    most amazing human beings I have ever known! So blessed to have you all a part of my path I know this is a big
                    change and may not work for some of you at this time and that’s okay. We are all just doing the best with what we have
                    in life! Do your best to “JUST BE” I appreciate you all for understanding that it’s time to follow my heart and step
                    into the next chapter of my story! For those of you I may not have the pleasure dancing with for a while, if I could
                    leave you with something, it’s that you take those moments to evaluate where you could go from where you’re at! We are
                    all capable of more than we even know. Face those fears, walk through those doors and seize those opportunities! Do your
                    version, live in love, follow your heart and always always keep dancing! All the LDUB!
